# First Order Logic in Idris

These are some examples of first-order logic derivation using the Idris programming language. It's really fun! Compared to Haskell, Idris seems much more fluid and unrestricted - which must come from deep support for dependent types. Compare to Coq, Idris really shows off its power as a bottom-up programming language rather than mere proof-assistant. Me, having much more experience with instructional and object oriented coding, Coq comes off as keyword-filled and arbitrary. So Idris comes in to offer the programmer flavor!

The 'exams' in this repository are from taken from the Philosophy 201 - Logic course at Reed College.
